 <h2>Prelude</h2> 
  <p>During this interview, I chose to interview <strong>Percy Liu</strong>as my partner.
    We did it on the most popular app in China currently which is Wechat. We were friends since freshmen year.<br>

    learn how to design. Interactive 1 since easy to Percy due to that he likes to play computer games

    <h2>Conversation</h2>
    <p>Q:what is ‘good’ screen-based design?</p>
    <p>A:First of all, I think the whole page to be clear and concise, if particularly messy also need
         some order, rather than for the sake of chaos to chaos. Secondly, text font and size should be moderate.</p>
    <p>Q:how is 90-making online different then art-making offline?</p>    
    <p>A:With the addition of code, web design becomes more difficult than normal design. Normal designs can be drawn 
        directly or with other Adobe software, while web designs have to constantly changing the code.</p>
    <p>Q:what do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web?</p>
    <p>A:Web design can have more content, and the Internet now a days is developed, almost everyone can surf the
         Internet. You need to have good web design and interesting content for more people to see, so that people will be willing to put ads on your site and make profit.</p>
    <p>Q:how has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time</p>
    <p>A:Both love and hate. Like because of the Internet, access to information more convenient, easily communication, more entertainment projects. Hate because now there 
        are more people addicted to the Internet, abandoned the real life.
        </p>
    <p>Q:how does the web impact graphic design?</p>
    <p>A:When I was young, the Internet was not developed, and my parents did not allow me to touch the Internet because of my study. When I was in junior high school,
         I came into contact with the Internet, just like Columbus discovered the new continent.</p>
    <p>Q:What will screen based design grow in the future?</p>   
    <p>A:Let graphic design have more space to show, and then more direct.</p>  
    <p>Q:What do you think the internet will grow in the future/</p>
    <p>A:In the future, vr may be as developed as current mobile phones, so that people will surf the Internet on vr and become more three-dimensional.</p>
